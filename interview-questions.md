# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
    It is a block of code that performs a specific task
  Researched answer:
    The function is invoked only when you call the function.


2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer:
    .map() is a higher order function that returns a new array where you have applied a function on the element and changes the original element.  And .filter() also returns a new array of the elements but does not change the original values.

  Researched answer:
    .filter() returns subset of the elements from the original array. and .map() produces and array with a new and different entries based on the elements in the original array.


3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:
    console.log() strictly is for your terminal that logs whatever arguments you call.  and return is a statement that gives an output from a functions     

  Researched answer:
    console.log() has no practical use to a program.  return allows you to pass the variable's value to the calling scope.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:
    its an accessible object inside a function that has values passed into a function.

  Researched answer:
    All arguments passed to a JavaScript function can be referred using the arguments object.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
      steady communication, making sure each person takes equal ammount of turns navigating and driving.  Being respectul and patient.  The roles of each person in paired programming is one person is called the "driver" where that person is sharing their screen is the one that is actually doing the coding, and the other person is called the "navigator" where that person is looking ahead and figuring out problems and double checking the drivers work

  Researched answer:
    paired proggraming is used for higher quality code, it is faster and it also reduces risk.


6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer:
      TDD stands for test driven development, tests are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.  you first have to write code that fails in order for you to write new functional code.

  Researched answer:
    It forces you to think about smaller chunks of code at a time rather than the application at a whole.


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
      the most helpful thing we did in class this week was by far the team building activities because it helps all of us get to know eachother better and allows us to be more comfortable with eachother down the road.
